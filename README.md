# My Thesis


[Dataset!](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/vpn.html) : VPN-nonVPN dataset (ISCXVPN2016) 

I have used the mentioned dataset for my thesis research. This dataset contains pcap files, I have converted these files to pickle files and then read the numbers in files, which represents the traffic data for each app, then I have calculated cross-entropy of those numbers using sliding windows with different window size; four window size have been used here: 2, 4, 6, 8.

### Future work:

Using other window sizes.
Using sliding window on some part of traffic instead of all of it.
